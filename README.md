# Incremental RRT with Dubins
A motion planning algorithm which could be used for non-holonomic autonomous agents.

In this repository, you will find an implementation of how to calculate a Dubins path, an implementation of RRT with Dubins and RRT* with Dubins, and finally an implementation of Incremetal RRT with Dubins.

Having an implementation of how to calcultae Dubins path is not necessary since there is a Dubins library which specifically computes the Dubins Shortest path.

This is how the Incremental RRT would like and how its Trajectory would look like
