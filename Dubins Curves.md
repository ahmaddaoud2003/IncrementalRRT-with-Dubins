# Dubins Curves
  In 1957, Lester Dubins declared that the shortest path consists of a maximum of three segments in which each segment could be a circular arc or a straight line. There are six possible Dubinsâ€™ curves that are classified into two categories.
## Category 1: Curve Straight Curve - CSC:
  In this algorithm the robot will turn, move straight and then turn again.
  ### RSR:
    Turn right, move straight, and then turn right again.
  ### LSR:
    Turn left, move straight, and then turn right.
  ### RSL:
    Turn right, move straight, and then turn left.
  ### LSL:
    Turn left, move straight, and then turn left again.
## Category 2: Curve Curve Curve - CCC:
  In this path, the robot will turn, then turn in the oppsosite direction, and turn again.
  ### RLR:
    Turn right, turn left, and then turn right again.
  ### LRL:
    Turn left, turn right, and then turn left again.
